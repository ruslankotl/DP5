# Relative Stereochemistry Determination Examples

This folder contains the DP4-AI [1] relative stereochemistry test set. Molecules AT3, TS3A, TS4 and NL1A were excluded from the original set due to lack of 13C NMR data. The first SD File contains the correct stereoisomer. For example, the correct diastereomer in `AT1` folder is `AT1_1.sdf`.
